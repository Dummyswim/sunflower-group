System Overview
Your program is correctly accumulating candles but hasn't triggered analysis yet because it needs 50 minute candles (MIN_DATA_POINTS) before starting signal generation. You've collected 40 candles so far (23:10 to 23:49).
Program Architecture & Flow
1. Data Collection Phase (Current Stage)
WebSocket receives real-time tick data from Dhan API
Creates 1-minute OHLC candles from ticks
Stores up to 500 candles in memory
Status: ✅ Working correctly - creating candles every minute
2. Signal Analysis Phase (Starts after 50 candles)
The system calculates signals at multiple levels:
Technical Indicators & Weights:
text


MACD        : 25% weight - Trend momentum
RSI         : 20% weight - Overbought/Oversold  
VWAP        : 20% weight - Volume-weighted price
Keltner     : 15% weight - Volatility channels
Supertrend  : 15% weight - Trend direction
Impulse MACD: 5%  weight - EMA + MACD combo
Signal Strength Calculation:
Consensus Analysis (40%): Counts bullish vs bearish indicators
Trend Strength (30%): Linear regression + MA alignment + Higher highs/lows
Momentum (20%): MACD acceleration + Volume spikes
Patterns (10%): Candlestick patterns (hammer, engulfing, etc.)
3. Confidence Levels & Metrics
Primary Confidence Metrics:
Signal Accuracy: Historical correctness (currently 50% default, improves over time)
Confidence Sustenance: How well high-confidence signals perform
Win Rate: Percentage of profitable signals
Duration Confidence: Prediction reliability (low/medium/high)
Signal Thresholds:
python


Strong Buy  : Score >= 0.6  (60% weighted consensus)
Buy         : Score >= 0.3  (30% weighted consensus)  
Weak Buy    : Score >= 0.1  (10% weighted consensus)
Neutral     : -0.1 < Score < 0.1
Weak Sell   : Score <= -0.1
Sell        : Score <= -0.3
Strong Sell : Score <= -0.6
Alert Conditions:
Minimum confidence: 40% (reduced from 60%)
Minimum score: |0.25| (reduced from 0.5)
Cooldown: 120 seconds between alerts
Strong signals (STRONG_BUY/SELL) override cooldown
4. Key Price Levels
Calculated from recent 20 candles:
Resistance: Highest high of last 20 candles
Support: Lowest low of last 20 candles
Pivot: (Resistance + Support + Current Price) / 3
5. Duration Prediction
Estimates how long signal will persist based on:
Momentum strength (multiplier: 1x to 3x)
Trend consistency (R² value from linear regression)
Supertrend stability (consecutive candles in same direction)
Base duration: 5 minutes, adjusted to 5-30 minutes range
6. Enhanced Signal Generator
Uses advanced analysis:
Pattern Recognition: Hammer, shooting star, engulfing patterns
Divergence Detection: Price vs indicator divergence
Momentum Tracking: Acceleration and deceleration
Risk Management: Auto-calculated stop-loss (2×ATR) and take-profit (3×ATR)
Current Status
Your system is in the accumulation phase. In about 10 more minutes (at 23:59 or 00:00), when you have 50 candles, the system will:
Start calculating all technical indicators
Generate weighted signals every minute
Send Telegram alerts when thresholds are met
Include charts with technical overlays
Provide accuracy metrics and duration predictions
Alert Information Provided
When triggered, alerts will include:
Signal type (STRONG_BUY, BUY, SELL, etc.)
Current price and timestamp
Signal accuracy percentage (improves over time)
Confidence of sustenance (likelihood signal continues)
Expected duration (5-30 minutes typically)
Individual indicator signals with contributions
Key support/resistance levels
Risk-reward ratio with stop-loss/take-profit
Technical analysis chart with all indicators plotted
The system is designed to improve accuracy over time by tracking historical performance and adjusting confidence metrics based on actual outcomes.
