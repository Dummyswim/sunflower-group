## Summary

- Symbols scanned: **1860**

- Top shortlist shown: **30**


## Fundamental veto (skip / deprioritize)

These may look technically attractive, but quarterly net profit YoY is <= -10%. Treat as watch-only unless you have a strong separate thesis.

### EQUITY

- **SALONA** (fundamentals: Net Profit YoY -51.1%; Fundamental VETO) (support below | caution: profit growth is negative/weak (veto)): Technicals may look good, but fundamentals veto this setup. Skip for swing entries unless you have a separate thesis. If you still track it, treat it as watch-only.
- **IMFA** (fundamentals: Net Profit YoY -21.6%; Fundamental VETO) (support below | caution: profit growth is negative/weak (veto)): Technicals may look good, but fundamentals veto this setup. Skip for swing entries unless you have a separate thesis. If you still track it, treat it as watch-only.
- **INDUSTOWER** (fundamentals: Net Profit YoY -17.3%; Fundamental VETO) (support below | caution: profit growth is negative/weak (veto)): Technicals may look good, but fundamentals veto this setup. Skip for swing entries unless you have a separate thesis. If you still track it, treat it as watch-only.
- **RPTECH** (fundamentals: Net Profit YoY -15.7%; Fundamental VETO) (caution: profit growth is negative/weak (veto)): Technicals may look good, but fundamentals veto this setup. Skip for swing entries unless you have a separate thesis. If you still track it, treat it as watch-only.
- **IDEA** (fundamentals: Net Profit YoY -23.0%; Fundamental VETO) (caution: price is stretched, wait for a pullback; profit growth is negative/weak (veto)): Technicals may look good, but fundamentals veto this setup. Skip for swing entries unless you have a separate thesis. If you still track it, treat it as watch-only.
- **VSTTILLERS** (fundamentals: Net Profit YoY -44.4%; Fundamental VETO) (caution: profit growth is negative/weak (veto)): Technicals may look good, but fundamentals veto this setup. Skip for swing entries unless you have a separate thesis. If you still track it, treat it as watch-only.

## Actionable (breakout + volume confirmed)

These broke out on a daily close with strong volume and look clean. Use the entry/stop/target plan.

_None in this section._

## Actionable with caution

Breakout signal is present, but caution flags exist (extended price, heavy volume overhead, or weak fundamentals). Prefer waiting for hold/pullback or reduce size.

### EQUITY

- **LOTUSEYE** (fundamentals: Net Profit YoY +20.0%) (support below | caution: price is stretched, wait for a pullback): Breakout is happening, but there are caution flags. Better action: wait for 1–3 days of holding above resistance or a pullback closer to support/EMA20, then enter. If you still enter, consider smaller size. Reference levels: entry ~ ₹130.35, stop ~ ₹121.16, first target ~ ₹148.72.

## Watchlist (near breakout, waiting for trigger)

These are close to resistance. Wait for a daily close above resistance with higher volume, then enter.
