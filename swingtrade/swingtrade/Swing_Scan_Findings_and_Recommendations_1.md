This report is plain-English. It tells you what to do next for each symbol.


## Summary

- Symbols scanned: **420**

- Top shortlist shown: **30**


## Fundamental veto (skip / deprioritize)

These may look technically attractive, but quarterly net profit YoY is <= -10%. Treat as watch-only unless you have a strong separate thesis.

### EQUITY

- **AXISBANK** (fundamentals: Net Profit YoY -25.1%; Fundamental VETO) (caution: profit growth is negative/weak (veto)): Technicals may look good, but fundamentals veto this setup. Skip for swing entries unless you have a separate thesis. If you still track it, treat it as watch-only.
- **ABCAPITAL** (fundamentals: Net Profit YoY -13.6%; Fundamental VETO) (caution: profit growth is negative/weak (veto)): Technicals may look good, but fundamentals veto this setup. Skip for swing entries unless you have a separate thesis. If you still track it, treat it as watch-only.
- **ADANIENSOL** (fundamentals: Net Profit YoY -27.9%; Fundamental VETO) (caution: profit growth is negative/weak (veto)): Technicals may look good, but fundamentals veto this setup. Skip for swing entries unless you have a separate thesis. If you still track it, treat it as watch-only.
- **BLACKBUCK** (fundamentals: Net Profit YoY -110.8%; Fundamental VETO) (less traffic above | caution: profit growth is negative/weak (veto)): Technicals may look good, but fundamentals veto this setup. Skip for swing entries unless you have a separate thesis. If you still track it, treat it as watch-only.
- **ABINFRA** (fundamentals: Net Profit YoY -900.0%; Fundamental VETO) (caution: profit growth is negative/weak (veto)): Technicals may look good, but fundamentals veto this setup. Skip for swing entries unless you have a separate thesis. If you still track it, treat it as watch-only.

## Actionable (breakout + volume confirmed)

These broke out on a daily close with strong volume and look clean. Use the entry/stop/target plan.
